**Welcome!** I‚Äôm **Qijia Chen**, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the **University of Helsinki**, fortunate to be supervised by **Giulio Jacucci**. I also work closely with **Andrea Bellucci** as my secondary supervisor.  

In 2025, I was an academic intern at **Abraham Mhaidli‚Äôs Alpaca group** at the **Max Planck Institute**. I obtained my Bachelor‚Äôs degree from Chongqing University and Master‚Äôs degree from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My work combines qualitative and quantitative methods, design research, and prototype development to create inclusive interactive media.  

<div style="text-align: center; text-indent: 2em;">
I‚Äôm actively seeking <strong>collaboration opportunities</strong>, especially in <strong>VR</strong>, <strong>collaborative virtual environments</strong>, <strong>UI agents</strong>, <strong>generative AI</strong>, or other related research areas.  
Feel free to <strong>drop me an email</strong>!
